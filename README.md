Here’s a sample README file for your Roblox money system, explaining the setup and how to use it.

Roblox Money System
This is a simple Roblox money system that saves a player's money and automatically adds 1 money every minute. The system is designed to work in ServerScriptService and uses DataStore to save the player's progress.

Features:
Adds 1 money to the player every 60 seconds.
Saves and loads the player's money using Roblox's DataStore.
Displays the player's money in the leaderboard (leaderstats).
Installation:
Copy or Add Script:

Copy the provided script or add it to your game inside ServerScriptService.
You can rename the script to MoneySystem if you'd like.
Enable DataStore:

Go to Game Settings > Security.
Ensure Enable Studio Access to API Services is checked, so that DataStores can work correctly.
How It Works:
When a player joins, the system checks if they have existing money saved.
If money is found, it loads that data. If not, it starts at 0.
Every minute, the system automatically adds 1 money to the player.
The player’s money is displayed in the leaderboard (via leaderstats).
When the player leaves, their money is saved so it can be loaded when they rejoin.
How to Customize:
Change the Money Increment:
Modify the moneyPerMinute variable in the script to change how much money is added per minute.

Change the Update Interval:
Adjust the updateInterval variable to control how often money is added (default is 60 seconds).

Troubleshooting:
Data not saving?
Make sure that Enable Studio Access to API Services is turned on in Game Settings > Security.
